# Whisky Tracker

This exercise was tasked to me by CodeClan, Glasgow where I studied towards a PDA Level 8 in Professional Software Development. The exercise brief can be found below.

## Brief

Given the basic code for classes and JpaRepositories for a whisky tracker, your task for this lab is to complete the custom queries and connected them to appropriate RESTful endpoints.

Write each of the following queries and connect them to an appropriate controller:

**MVP**

- Get all the whiskies for a particular year
- Get all the distilleries for a particular region
- Get all the whisky from a particular distillery that’s a specific age

**Extensions**

- Get all the whisky from a particular region
- Get distilleries that have whiskies that are 12 years old
